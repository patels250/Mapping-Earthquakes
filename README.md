# Mapping-Earthquakes

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to plot real-time earthquake data on a world map. These maps are interactive and feature the ability to change style, as well as turn on/off the display of earthquakes and tectonic plates. Every earthquake marker features a popup when clicked that shows the magnitude and location of the earthquake.
